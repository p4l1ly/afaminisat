How to improve performance further
==================================

- DONE, VERY_GOOD_IMPACT VarOrder: tolerance grows slower than liveness step
- Less memory jumping:
    - DONE LogLists are used in the trie, which can cause memory jumping.
      - DONE we can increase granularity of LogLists. AND MAYBE THIS (for snapshots)
      - WONT_DO we can put the first LogList array in directly into the structure.
      - DONE we can solidify the structure into one big array. AND MAYBE THIS (impossible for AFA,
        are clauses solidified?)
      - DONE we can use arrays for VerHeads, vectors for HorHeads and detect reallocation.
        - current solution is not compatible for antichains (dynamic adding of verheads), it would
          need the following modification: verhead->above points to the leftmost horhead and
          therefore, in iteration, if is_hor, we should do double derefrence verhead->above->above.
        - or maybe instead, reallocation could iterate through the horline below and adapt each
          "above"

- DONE, GOOD_IMPACT Sort literals in input clauses from the most frequent (globally) to the least frequent one

- DONE Switch VarOrder
- DONE Try to merge analyze and analyze2
- DONE (NEW_ANALYZE has 4 times worse result at the first benchmark, randomness?). Switch analyze

- DONE Try to run original MiniSAT (v1.12 and v1.14)
- DONE Try to run at least one external high end SAT solver (SBVA Cadical, CryptoMiniSAT)

- DONE, VERY_GOOD_IMPACT VarOrder: prefer watched variables? 1 - 2d
- DONE VarOrder: finish skipped variables (useful for antichain) 3h
- DONE novan (SoloGuard) 1d
- WatchVarOrder: clauses can watch/unwatch too 1h (C_FLAGS: learnt clauses too? which of the two watches?)

Then
====

- Reapply AFA stuff. 2d
    - track accepting place
    - onSat

- Try to run at least one external incremental SAT solver - without maximization of outputs (we
  should be much better because of this nonmaximization) - CryptoMiniSAT 3h

- switch various features on/off - posq outputs, purity, directedness (directed boolean operators,
  directed clauses) 3h

- Compare thoroughly in all settings with all AFA model checkers and the selected SAT solvers. 1d

- learnt clauses in trie?
