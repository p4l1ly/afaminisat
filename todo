How to improve performance further
==================================

SAT related
===========

- DONE, VERY_GOOD_IMPACT VarOrder: tolerance grows slower than liveness step
- Less memory jumping:
    - DONE LogLists are used in the trie, which can cause memory jumping.
      - DONE we can increase granularity of LogLists. AND MAYBE THIS (for snapshots)
      - WONT_DO we can put the first LogList array directly into the structure.
      - DONE we can solidify the structure into one big array. AND MAYBE THIS (impossible for AFA,
        are clauses solidified?)
      - DONE we can use arrays for VerHeads, vectors for HorHeads and detect reallocation.
        - current solution is not compatible for antichains (dynamic adding of verheads), it would
          need the following modification: verhead->above points to the leftmost horhead and
          therefore, in iteration, if is_hor, we should do double derefrence verhead->above->above.
        - or maybe instead, reallocation could iterate through the horline below and adapt each
          "above"

- DONE, GOOD_IMPACT Sort literals in input clauses from the most frequent (globally) to the least frequent one

- DONE Switch VarOrder
- DONE Try to merge analyze and analyze2
- DONE (NEW_ANALYZE has 4 times worse result at the first benchmark, randomness?). Switch analyze

- DONE Try to run original MiniSAT (v1.12 and v1.14)
- DONE Try to run at least one external high end SAT solver (SBVA Cadical, CryptoMiniSAT)

- DONE, VERY_GOOD_IMPACT VarOrder: prefer watched variables? 1 - 2d
- DONE VarOrder: finish skipped variables (useful for antichain) 3h
- DONE novan (SoloGuard) 1d
- DONE WatchVarOrder: clauses can watch/unwatch too 1h (C_FLAGS: learnt clauses too? which of the two watches?)

Then, AFA related
=================

- Reapply AFA stuff. 3d
    - DONE mark indirect "above" or use ifdef AFA
    - DONE track deepest rightmost rear/solo. for each rear, track deepest rightmost accepted van
    - DONE onSat 1d
    - DONE add antichain clause => raise nLearnts 20m
    - DONE Main, Solver->order.select, CMakeLists 3h
    - DONE try, debug 1d

- Try to run at least one external incremental SAT solver - CryptoMiniSAT
    - DONE without maximization of outputs (e should be much better because of this nonmaximization)
    - WONT_DO with MaxSAT
    - WONT_DO implement two orders in CryptoMiniSAT

- DONE switch various features on/off - posq outputs, purity, directedness (directed boolean
  operators, directed clauses) 3h

- WONT_DO random order 1h

- Compare thoroughly in all settings with all AFA model checkers and the selected SAT solvers. 1d

- WONT_DO learnt clauses in trie?

Measurements
============

AFA
  - tiny: measure5 with 1000 benchmarks per bench set (60 was still quite a little to see impact of
    flags clearly)

  # On some Verifit server?
  - all benchmarks: vanilla clause, best clause, vanilla trie, best trie, (nuXmv), abc, mata

SAT if we have time: presort+trie, then, maybe run all again with sbva
